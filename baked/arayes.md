### 1. Prepare the Filling

1. In a bowl, combine the ground meat, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, and optional parsley.  
2. Mix well by hand until all ingredients are evenly distributed.

### 2. Fill the Pitas

1. Cut each pita into halves or wedges (depending on size).  
2. Gently open each piece to create a pocket.  
3. Spread a thin layer of meat mixture inside. (Don’t overstuff; a thin layer cooks faster.)

### 3. Cook

**Option A: Grill or Grill Pan**  

1. Lightly brush the outside of the pita with olive oil or melted butter.  
2. Place on a **medium-high** grill or grill pan.  
3. Cook for **3–4 minutes** per side, pressing lightly so the meat cooks evenly.

**Option B: Pan-Fry**  

1. Heat a skillet over medium heat with a drizzle of oil.  
2. Place arayes in the skillet and cook until browned, about **3–4 minutes** per side.

**Option C: Bake**  

1. Preheat oven to **400°F (200°C)**.  
2. Arrange arayes on a baking sheet and brush lightly with oil.  
3. Bake for **10–15 minutes**, flipping once, until the meat is fully cooked and the pita is crisp.

### 4. Serve

1. Cut into smaller wedges if desired.  
2. Serve hot with tahini sauce, yogurt sauce, or chopped salad on the side.

## Tips

- For extra flavor, add a little chili or sumac to the meat mixture.  
- Try mixing beef and lamb for a richer taste.  
- Make sure the meat layer is thin, so it cooks through without overbrowning the pita.
