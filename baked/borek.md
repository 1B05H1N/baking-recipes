### 1. Prepare Filling

1. If using **spinach**, sauté it lightly with onions; squeeze out excess liquid.  
2. If using **meat**, brown it with onions, garlic, and spices, then drain excess fat.  
3. If using **cheese** alone, just mix it with herbs.  
4. Season filling to taste and allow to cool.

### 2. Layer the Phyllo

1. Preheat oven to **350°F (180°C)**.  
2. Grease or line your baking dish.  
3. Unroll phyllo; cover with a slightly damp towel to prevent drying.  
4. Place one sheet of phyllo in the dish; brush with melted butter or oil.  
5. Repeat with **3–4 sheets**, brushing each. This forms the base.  
6. Spread **½** of your filling over the layered sheets.  

### 3. Add More Layers

1. Layer another **2–3** sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter/oil.  
2. Spread the remaining filling on top.  
3. Top with **3–4** more sheets of phyllo, brushing each.  

### 4. Finishing Touches

1. (Optional) Whisk together **1 egg** and a splash of **milk**; brush over the top layer for extra browning.  
2. Cut the börek into serving squares or triangles **before** baking to make it easier to serve later.

### 5. Bake

1. Bake for **25–30 minutes**, or until the top is golden brown and crisp.  
2. Let it rest for **5–10 minutes** to set before slicing.

## Tips

- Keep phyllo from drying out by covering it with plastic wrap or a damp cloth while you work.  
- Serve warm or at room temperature—both are delicious.  
- Leftovers can be reheated in an oven or air fryer to maintain crispness.
