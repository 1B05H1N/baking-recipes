## **Instructions**

### **1. Prepare the Dough**
1. In the mixing bowl, combine:
   - 462 grams of warm water (filtered around 120 degrees F).
   - 3 grams of yeast.
   - 6 grams of sugar.
   - 1 tablespoon olive oil.  
2. Stir the mixture well until the yeast and sugar dissolve.
3. Let mixture sit until yeast blooms (bubbles will form at top of bowl)
4. Add 652 grams of bread flour on top of the liquid.  
5. Add 8 grams of salt on top of the flour (avoid direct contact with the yeast initially).

### **2. Mix the Dough**
1. Attach the dough hook to your mixer and mix at **speed 1** for 2–3 minutes.
   - Mix just until the dough comes together and cleans the sides of the bowl. Avoid overmixing to keep the dough tender.

### **3. First Rise**
1. Lightly coat a baking pan with olive oil.  
2. Transfer the dough to the pan and cover it with a clean kitchen towel.  
3. Let the dough rest overnight in a cool place (ideally around 50–60°F, or use the refrigerator).

### **4. Shaping**
1. The next day, turn the dough out onto a floured surface.  
2. Portion the dough into approximately **371-gram pieces** (or as desired).  
3. Lightly shape each piece into a round or loaf shape. Avoid overhandling to preserve the dough's structure.  

---

### **5. Second Rise**
1. Place the shaped dough into a lightly floured proofing basket or on a baking sheet.  
2. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise until the dough doubles in size (approximately 1–2 hours, depending on room temperature).

### **6. Baking**
1. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach (usually **425°F to 475°F**). Place a baking stone or tray in the oven to preheat as well.  
2. Fill an oven-safe tray with **hot water** and place it on the bottom rack of the oven to create steam. This steam helps create a crisp crust.  
   - Keep the water tray in the oven for the **first 20 minutes of baking**.  
3. Once the oven is preheated, transfer the dough to the hot baking surface (tray or stone).  
4. Bake until the bread is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches **190–200°F** (approximately **25–30 minutes**, depending on loaf size).

## **Tips**
- **Steam**: Steam during the first 20 minutes is crucial for achieving a crisp, artisan-style crust.  
- **Flour Your Basket**: Use rice flour or a mix of all-purpose flour to prevent the dough from sticking to the proofing basket.  
- **Cool Before Cutting**: Allow the bread to cool completely before slicing to let the crumb set properly.
