### 1. Prepare the Dough

1. In a bowl, dissolve **yeast** (and optional **sugar**) in **warm water**. Let it stand for **5 minutes**, until foamy.  
2. Add the **flour**, **salt**, and **olive oil**.  
3. Knead the dough for **8–10 minutes**, until smooth and elastic.

### 2. First Rise

1. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl.  
2. Cover and let it rise for **1 hour**, or until roughly doubled in size.

### 3. Prepare Fillings

1. **Spinach Filling**:  
   - Wash and chop spinach.  
   - Sauté with onions, olive oil, sumac, lemon juice, salt, and pepper until wilted.  
   - Drain any excess liquid to avoid soggy pastries.  
2. **Cheese Filling**:  
   - Crumble feta or use diced akkawi cheese.  
   - Mix with chopped parsley or mint.  
3. **Meat Filling**:  
   - Brown ground beef or lamb with onions and spices (salt, pepper, cumin, paprika).  
   - Optionally add pine nuts.  
   - Cool before filling.

### 4. Shape & Fill

1. Punch down the dough and divide into **12–16** pieces.  
2. Roll each piece into a **3–4 inch** circle.  
3. Place a spoonful of filling in the center.  
4. For **spinach or cheese fatayer** (triangular shape):  
   - Fold the dough from three sides, pinching tightly at each seam to form a triangle.  
5. For **meat fatayer** (boat shape or closed round):  
   - Fold two opposite sides together, pinch along the center, and leave ends slightly open; or  
   - Gather edges to form a sealed pouch.  

### 5. Final Proof & Bake

1. Place the filled pastries on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  
2. Cover loosely and let them rest for **15–20 minutes**.  
3. Preheat the oven to **375°F (190°C)**.  
4. Brush the tops with a bit of olive oil or egg wash (optional).  
5. Bake for **15–20 minutes**, or until golden brown.

### 6. Serve

1. Serve warm as an appetizer or side dish.  
2. They’re also delicious at room temperature, making them great for picnics or lunch boxes.

## Tips

- Ensure the filling isn’t too wet, or the dough may tear and leak during baking.  
- Adjust spices to your preference; Middle Eastern spice blends (like baharat or cumin) add depth of flavor.  
- Leftover fatayer can be stored in the fridge or frozen; reheat in an oven or air fryer for a crisp finish.
