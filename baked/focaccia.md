### 1. Mix the Dough

1. In a large bowl, whisk together **warm water**, **yeast**, and **olive oil** until the yeast dissolves.
2. Add the **flour** and **salt**. Mix on low or stir by hand until a sticky dough forms.

### 2. Bulk Fermentation

1. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp cloth.
2. Let it rise at **room temperature** (about 70°F) for **1–2 hours**, or until roughly doubled.
3. (Optional) Every 30 minutes, gently fold the dough over itself to build gluten structure.

### 3. Shape & Final Proof

1. Generously oil a baking sheet or large pan.
2. Transfer the risen dough onto the oiled pan.
3. Gently stretch and press the dough out to a thickness of **1–2 cm**.  
   - If it springs back, let it rest for 5 minutes and try again.
4. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let it rise another **30–45 minutes**.

### 4. Add Toppings & Bake

1. Preheat the oven to **425°F (220°C)**.
2. Drizzle more olive oil on top of the dough, then use your fingertips to create **dimples**.
3. Sprinkle on desired toppings (rosemary, olives, etc.).
4. Bake for **20–25 minutes**, or until golden brown on top.
5. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing.

## Tips

- For extra flavor, infuse your olive oil with garlic or herbs before drizzling on top.
- The dimples help hold the oil and toppings, creating focaccia’s characteristic texture.
- If you want a crisp bottom, bake directly on a heated stone or use a dark metal pan.
