### 1. Prepare the Dough

1. In a bowl, whisk together the **yeast** and **warm water**; let sit for **5 minutes** until slightly foamy.  
2. Add **flour**, **salt**, and optional **olive oil**.  
3. Knead for **8–10 minutes** (by hand or in a mixer) until smooth and elastic.  
4. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise for **1–1½ hours** or until doubled in size.

### 2. Make the Topping

1. In a bowl, combine **ground meat**, **onion**, **tomato**, **bell pepper**, **garlic**, **spices**, and **olive oil**.  
2. Mix thoroughly; the texture should be a spreadable paste.  
   - If it’s too thick, add a little more olive oil or a spoonful of water.

### 3. Shape & Top

1. Punch down the dough and divide it into **6–8** equal portions.  
2. Roll each portion into a thin circle (like a small pizza), about **¼ inch** thick or thinner.  
3. Place each round on a baking sheet or parchment paper.  
4. Spread a thin layer of the meat topping onto each dough round, leaving a small border.

### 4. Bake

1. Preheat your oven to **450°F (230°C)**.  
2. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.  
3. Bake each lahmacun for **8–10 minutes**, or until the edges are crisp and the topping is cooked.

### 5. Serve

1. Serve hot, typically topped with fresh parsley, onion slices, a squeeze of lime, or a dollop of yogurt or tahini sauce.  
2. Lahmacun is often rolled or folded before eating.

## Tips

- Adjust spice levels to your preference; some like extra heat with chili flakes.  
- Lamb is traditional, but beef works great. You can also do a half-lamb, half-beef blend.  
- Wrap leftover lahmacun in foil; reheat in a hot oven or skillet.
