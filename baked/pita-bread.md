### 2. Form the Dough

1. Add **flour**, **salt**, and optional **olive oil** to the yeast mixture.
2. Knead on low speed (or by hand) for **8–10 minutes**, until you have a smooth, elastic dough.

### 3. First Rise

1. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl.
2. Cover and let it rise for **1–1½ hours** or until doubled in size.

### 4. Shape

1. Divide the dough into **8–10** equal pieces.
2. Roll each piece into a ball; cover and let rest for **10 minutes**.
3. On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball into a **6–7 inch** circle.

### 5. Bake

1. Preheat your oven to **475°F (245°C)**. Place a baking stone or thick baking sheet on the middle rack.
2. Carefully place 2–3 rolled pitas on the hot surface.
3. Bake for **3–5 minutes**, or until they puff up and are lightly browned.

### 6. Cool

1. Remove from the oven and stack the pita breads in a clean towel to keep them soft.
2. Serve warm and enjoy with dips, wraps, or sandwiches.

## Tips

- If the pitas don’t puff perfectly, they’re still delicious! Use them as flatbreads or fold them into sandwiches.
- Adjust water slightly to get a smooth, pliable dough.
