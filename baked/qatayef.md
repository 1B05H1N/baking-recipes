# Qatayef

A sweet treat especially popular during Ramadan: small, fluffy pancakes filled with a sweet cheese or nut mixture, then fried or baked and drizzled with a fragrant sugar syrup.

## Ingredients

### Pancake Batter

- **250 g** all-purpose flour
- **1 tsp** baking powder
- **1 tbsp** sugar
- **¼ tsp** salt
- **350–400 ml** water (adjust for a pourable batter)
- **(Optional)** 1 tsp instant yeast + 1–2 tbsp warm water (for extra fluffiness)

### Filling Options

1. **Sweet Cheese**  
   - Use **ricotta**, **sweetened cream cheese**, or a Middle Eastern cheese (like akkawi, soaked to remove excess salt).  
   - Sweeten with **1–2 tbsp** sugar if desired.
2. **Nut Filling**  
   - **½ cup** finely chopped walnuts or pistachios  
   - **1–2 tbsp** sugar  
   - **½ tsp** ground cinnamon (optional)
   - A drizzle of **rosewater** or **orange blossom water** (optional)

### Sugar Syrup (Qattar)

- **1 cup** sugar
- **½ cup** water
- **1 tsp** lemon juice
- **1 tsp** rosewater or orange blossom water (optional)

## Equipment

- Mixing bowl or blender (for batter)

### 1. Make the Batter

1. In a bowl, whisk **flour**, **baking powder**, **sugar**, and **salt**.  
2. Gradually add **water** while stirring. The consistency should be like pancake batter.  
3. If using **yeast**, dissolve it in a little warm water and add to the mixture. Let the batter rest for **10–15 minutes**.

### 2. Sugar Syrup

1. In a small saucepan, combine **sugar** and **water**.  
2. Bring to a gentle boil; add **lemon juice**.  
3. Simmer for about **5–8 minutes** until slightly thickened.  
4. Remove from heat and stir in **rosewater** or **orange blossom water** (if desired). Cool before using.

### 3. Cook the Qatayef Pancakes

1. Heat a non-stick skillet over **medium** heat.  
2. Pour about **2–3 tbsp** of batter for each pancake (3–4 inches in diameter).  
3. Cook only on one side, until the surface is covered with tiny holes and appears dry.  
4. Transfer to a tray, bubble-side up. Cover with a towel to prevent drying.

### 4. Fill & Seal

1. **Cheese or Nut Filling**: Place **1 tbsp** of filling onto the bubble side of each pancake.  
2. Fold the pancake in half to form a **half-moon** shape. Pinch the edges firmly to seal.  

### 5. Fry or Bake

- **Frying**:  
  1. Heat oil to **350°F (175°C)**.  
  2. Fry for **1–2 minutes** per side, until golden.  
  3. Drain on paper towels, then immediately dip or drizzle with sugar syrup.  
- **Baking**:  
  1. Preheat oven to **400°F (200°C)**.  
  2. Brush or spray qatayef lightly with oil or melted butter.  
  3. Bake for **15–20 minutes**, flipping halfway, until lightly golden.  
  4. Drizzle with syrup while warm.

### 6. Serve

1. Arrange on a platter and garnish with crushed pistachios (optional).  
2. Serve warm, ideally the same day.

## Tips

- For a lighter texture, let the pancake batter rest so the baking powder (and yeast, if used) can activate.  
- Seal edges thoroughly to avoid filling leaks.  
- Adjust sweetness by adding more or less sugar to the filling and syrup.
