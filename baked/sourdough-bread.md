# Sourdough Bread

A tangy loaf with a crisp crust and open crumb, thanks to a naturally fermented sourdough starter.

## Ingredients

- **500 g** bread flour (or a blend of bread + whole wheat flour)
- **350 g** water (room temperature)
- **100 g** active sourdough starter (100% hydration, recently fed)
- **10 g** salt

## Equipment

- Mixing bowl or stand mixer with dough hook
- Proofing basket (or bowl lined with a floured cloth)
- Dutch oven (preferred) or baking stone + oven-safe tray for steam
- Kitchen scale
- Sharp blade or lame for scoring

### 1. Autolyse

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the **bread flour** and **water**.
2. Mix until the flour is fully hydrated; cover and let it rest for **30 minutes**.

### 2. Incorporate Starter & Salt

1. Add the **100 g of sourdough starter** and **10 g of salt**.
2. Knead on low speed (or by hand) for **3–5 minutes**, until everything is fully combined.

### 3. Bulk Fermentation

1. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp cloth.
2. Let the dough ferment at **room temperature** (70–75°F) for **3–4 hours**, or until it has roughly doubled in size.
3. Every **30 minutes** for the first 2 hours, perform a **stretch & fold**:
   - Gently pull one side of the dough up and fold it over the center. Rotate the bowl 90°, and repeat 3 more times.

### 4. Shaping

1. Lightly flour a work surface.
2. Turn the dough out and shape it into a round (boule) or batard (oval).  
3. Place the shaped dough seam-side **up** in a floured proofing basket.

### 5. Final Proof

1. Cover and refrigerate overnight (8–12 hours) for improved flavor,  
   **or** proof at room temperature for **1–2 hours**, until the dough looks slightly puffy.

### 6. Baking

1. Preheat the oven to **450°F (230°C)** with a Dutch oven inside (if using).
2. Carefully flip the dough onto parchment paper or a floured peel, seam-side down.
3. Score the top with a sharp blade or lame.
4. **Dutch Oven Method**:
   - Place the dough inside the hot Dutch oven and cover with the lid.  
   - Bake covered for **20 minutes** to trap steam, then remove the lid and bake for another **20–25 minutes**, until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature is **200–205°F**.
5. Cool on a wire rack for at least **1 hour** before slicing.

## Tips

- Make sure your starter is active and bubbly before use.
- The overnight proof (retard) in the fridge deepens flavor and improves crust/crumb.
- Always allow the loaf to cool thoroughly to maintain its structure.
