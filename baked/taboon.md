# Taboon

Taboon is a Palestinian flatbread, baked in a clay oven or on a domed surface. It’s slightly thicker than a tortilla but still soft, making it great for wraps or tearing and dipping.

## Ingredients

- **500 g** all-purpose flour  
- **300–320 g** warm water (around 100°F)  
- **7 g** instant yeast (approx. 2¼ tsp)  
- **8 g** salt  
- **1 tbsp** olive oil (optional)  
- **1 tsp** sugar (optional, aids in fermentation)  

## Equipment

- Mixing bowl or stand mixer  
- Rolling pin  
- Thick skillet or pizza stone (if you don’t have a traditional taboon oven)  
- Kitchen scale

### 1. Mix the Dough

1. In a bowl, combine **warm water**, **yeast**, and optional **sugar**. Let stand for **5 minutes**, until slightly foamy.  
2. Add the **flour**, **salt**, and optional **olive oil**.  
3. Knead on low speed or by hand for **8–10 minutes**, until you get a smooth, elastic dough.

### 2. First Rise

1. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and let it rest for **1–1½ hours**, or until doubled in size.  
2. If your kitchen is cool, place the bowl somewhere slightly warm (75–80°F).

### 3. Shape

1. Gently punch down the dough to release excess gas.  
2. Divide the dough into **6–8** equal pieces.  
3. Roll each piece into a ball; cover and let them rest for **10 minutes** to relax the gluten.  
4. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a **¼-inch thick** round.

### 4. Cook

1. Heat a thick skillet or pizza stone over **medium-high** heat (about 400°F if you have a thermometer).  
2. Place one rolled dough on the hot surface. Cook for **2–3 minutes**, or until bubbles form and the underside has golden-brown spots.  
3. Flip and cook the other side for **1–2 minutes**.  
4. Repeat with remaining dough rounds.

### 5. Serve & Store

1. Stack the cooked taboon breads in a clean towel to keep them soft and warm.  
2. Serve immediately with dips (hummus, baba ganoush) or use as a wrap for falafel, chicken, or shawarma.  

## Tips

- If the bread is browning too quickly, lower the heat slightly.  
- For an authentic smoky flavor, some cooks toss a bit of flour onto an open flame or hot stone, then place the dough on top.  
- Store leftover bread in an airtight bag; reheat on a skillet or in the oven.
