### 1. Activate the Yeast

1. In a bowl, combine **warm water**, **honey**, and **yeast**.
2. Stir to dissolve, then let it sit for about **5 minutes**, until slightly foamy.

### 2. Form the Dough

1. Add the **vegetable oil**, **whole wheat flour**, **bread flour**, and **salt** to the yeast mixture.
2. Knead by hand or use a stand mixer on low speed for **8–10 minutes**, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
   - If it’s too sticky, add extra flour a tablespoon at a time.

### 3. First Rise

1. Lightly oil a bowl and place the dough inside.
2. Cover and let it rise in a warm spot (75–80°F) for **1–1½ hours**, or until roughly doubled in size.

### 4. Shape

1. Punch down the dough to release excess gas.
2. Shape into a tight cylinder and place it seam-side down in a **greased loaf pan**.

### 5. Second Rise

1. Cover the loaf pan and let it rise again for **45–60 minutes**, or until it’s about 1 inch above the pan rim.

### 6. Bake

1. Preheat the oven to **375°F (190°C)**.
2. Bake for **30–35 minutes**, or until golden brown. The loaf should sound hollow when tapped.
3. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack for at least **30 minutes** before slicing.

## Tips

- Adding a bit of milk powder or substituting some of the water with milk can give a softer crumb.
- Brush the top with melted butter after baking for extra flavor and a softer crust.
- Slice and freeze any leftovers to keep the bread fresh.
